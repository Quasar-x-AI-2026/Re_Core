RECORE
Redefining Education & Career Opportunities with Real-time Evaluation

📌 Project Status
Early Development / Foundation Stage (Hackathon Phase)

RECORE is currently in its initial development phase.
The focus of this stage is to establish and validate the core reasoning engine, not to deliver a complete or production-ready system.

🧠 What is RECORE?
RECORE is a long-term learner companion system designed to help students:

understand how their learning is progressing over time

identify persistent confusion early

avoid continuing blindly into risky academic or career decisions

RECORE does not:

predict careers or outcomes

replace teachers or counsellors

rank or compare students

automate irreversible decisions

The system focuses on decision awareness, not automation.

🎯 Core Idea
At the heart of RECORE lies the Learner Trajectory Model (LTM).

A learner trajectory represents:

the evolving direction and stability of a learner over time, derived from observed learning behavior, engagement patterns, and consistency — not from one-time tests or labels.

Core principles:

Behavior first, marks second

Longitudinal understanding, not snapshots

Explainable reasoning over opaque intelligence

⚙️ RECORE Engine (Current Scope)
In this hackathon phase, the RECORE engine is:

Rule-driven

Explainable

Human-auditable

Cloud-dependent (online)

Use of Groq Chat Model
RECORE currently integrates a Groq-hosted chat model to assist with:

interpreting learner inputs and reflections

structuring guidance responses

maintaining conversational clarity

⚠️ Important clarification:

The Groq model does not make decisions

It does not predict learner outcomes

It does not replace the Learner Trajectory logic

All final judgments (stability, uncertainty, escalation) are governed by explicit rules and thresholds defined by the system, not by the model.

The model acts as a reasoning and interaction layer, not a black-box authority.

🔄 High-Level System Flow
Learning Interaction
Learner engages with content or problem statements

Problem-Solving Attempts
Learner applies understanding

Behavior Observation
Patterns such as repetition, hesitation, and stalled attempts are tracked

Rule-Based Evaluation

Stable patterns → no intervention

Persistent uncertainty → flagged for guidance

Guidance & Escalation

Flow-based, pre-scripted guidance

Human help suggested only when uncertainty remains unresolved

The system never forces decisions.

🧩 Guidance Philosophy
RECORE follows a layered response structure:

Understanding → observe over time

Guidance → structured, explainable prompts

Action → learner retries or reflects

Escalation → human support when system limits are reached

All guidance is:

explainable

traceable

reversible

🌐 Interface Status
Web-based interface (early stage)

Used to:

visualize learning flow

display uncertainty indicators

test reasoning logic

The interface is functional but minimal, and exists to support engine validation rather than presentation polish.

❌ Current Limitations (Explicit)
At this stage, RECORE is:

❌ Not offline-capable

❌ Not production-ready

❌ Not using machine learning for prediction

❌ Not automating decisions

Offline execution and local-first processing are future considerations, not current claims.

🛠️ Why We Started This Way
Rather than beginning with UI or feature expansion, RECORE begins with:

reasoning correctness

ethical safeguards

explainability

human-aligned decision boundaries

This ensures that future scaling does not compromise trust or clarity.

🚀 Roadmap (High-Level)
v0.5 (Current)
Rule-based trajectory logic + Groq-assisted interaction layer

v1
Rule refinement, clearer mentorship workflows

v2
Optional analytics assistance (still explainable)

v3 (Optional)
ML-assisted rule refinement (never replacing trajectory logic)

🧠 Design Commitments
No AI hype

No black-box authority

No forced decisions

Human judgment always prioritized

📍 Summary
RECORE is intentionally at the foundation stage.

Our progress is measured by:

correctness of logic

clarity of system boundaries

honesty about limitations

Not by feature count.
